   - structural (refactor only)
   - behavioral (feat/fix only)
4. Structural and behavioral changes are not mixed.

# Steps
1. Run local gate:
   ./.codex/skills/local-merge-gate/scripts/run_local_gate.sh
2. Review diff.
3. Confirm commit type.
4. Generate commit message template.

# Output
## Commit type
- structural / behavioral

## Suggested message
- structural: refactor: short summary
- behavioral: feat|fix: short summary

## Validation
- Gate: PASS/FAIL
- Mixed changes: YES/NO
